Restaurant Passport opens to the Home page, which includes some promotional content

The user should sign up, which will prompt them to log in. After logging in, the user will be redirected to their Passport.

Currently, the Passport page defaults to the pre-built API's city of Provo, UT where some sample restaurants are uploaded.

Each restaurant button can be clicked to add a star to the Passport page, which has one star to start with.
